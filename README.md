# image_converter
An image conversion API written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)! Supports `png`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, `bmp`, `tiff`, `ico`, `avif`, `heic`, `hdr`, `psd`, `cr2`, `pdf`, `qoi` & resizing

## Running
1. Download a binary from the **[releases tab](https://github.com/M336G/image_converter/releases/)** or clone the repository (if you have **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** installed). Make sure you've also got **[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)** installed.
2. Take a look at **[.env.example](https://github.com/M336G/image_converter/blob/main/.env.example)** and create a `.env` file if you need to configure your server.
3. Execute the binary you downloaded or use `cargo run --release` if you cloned the repository.

*You may additionally need to forward the port you chose and/or allow incoming requests to that port on your firewall.*

## Usage
Once you've got your instance running, you may use the `POST /` endpoint by supplying a `file` and a `format` or `dimensions` to it via multipart form data.

That's it, it's this simple!
